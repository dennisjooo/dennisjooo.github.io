  intro: `Hey, I'm Dennis — I like solving problems, learning weird stuff, and building things that (hopefully) make life a little easier. I’ve got a background in math and stats, but these days I’m more into what you can do with that knowledge — especially when it comes to AI, automation, and making things a bit smarter than they were yesterday.`,

  experience: `I've built and shipped ML apps, worked across different stacks, and helped teams get real value out of messy data. But honestly, what excites me most isn’t just the tech — it’s the moment when something clicks for someone, or when a rough idea turns into something real. I’m into making AI less intimidating, more useful, and ideally a little more fun. Whether it’s prototyping tools, building out workflows, or just tinkering until something works — that’s my happy place.`,

  personal: `Outside of work, you’ll usually find me reading ML papers I don’t fully understand (yet), scribbling down half-finished ideas, tearing through comics, or doing laps in sim racing like it actually matters. I’m a big fan of side projects — the stranger the better — and I really enjoy working on stuff that doesn’t have a clear roadmap. I think good ideas come from unexpected places, and I try to stay open to all of it.`,

  outro: `If you’re into data, design, or just making cool things — feel free to reach out. I’m always down to talk shop, swap ideas, or build something weird together.`,
