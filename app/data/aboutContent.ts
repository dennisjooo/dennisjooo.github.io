  intro: `Hey, I'm Dennis — AI nerd, stats guy, and someone who genuinely enjoys figuring stuff out. I come from a 
  strong background in math and statistics, and I spend most of my time building machine learning systems with Python, 
  R, and SQL. Whether it's deep learning with TensorFlow or prototyping fast in Torch, I'm all about using the right 
  tools to solve real problems.`,

  experience: `I've shipped machine learning apps to production using Azure, but I'm just as comfortable working 
  across different cloud platforms and deployment setups. My focus is on helping businesses turn data into decisions — 
  not just predictions, but insights that actually move the needle. I stay deep in the AI world, always exploring 
  new methods, models, and use cases.`,

  personal: `Outside of work, I'm probably reading ML papers, writing something, tearing through comics, 
  or losing track of time in sim racing. I like side projects that push me to learn — whether it's some weird new idea 
  or a tool that just needs to exist. If you're into data, AI, or just making cool stuff — let's talk.`,
