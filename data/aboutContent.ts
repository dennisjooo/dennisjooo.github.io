  intro: `Hey, I'm Dennis. I like solving problems, learning stuff, and building things that (hopefully) make life a little easier. I've got a background in Business Mathematics, but these days I'm more into what you can do with that knowledge, especially when it comes to AI, automation, and making things a bit smarter than they were yesterday.`,

  experience: `I've built and shipped ML apps, worked across different stacks, and helped teams get real value out of messy data. But honestly, what excites me most isn't just the tech, it's the moment when something clicks for someone, or when a rough idea turns into something real. I'm into making AI less intimidating, more useful, and ideally a little more fun. Whether it's prototyping tools, building out workflows, or just tinkering until something works, that's my happy place.`,

  personal: `Outside of work, you'll usually find me reading ML papers I don't fully understand (yet), scribbling down half-finished ideas, tearing through comics, or doing laps in sim racing like it actually matters. I'm a big fan of side projects, the stranger the better, and I really enjoy working on stuff that doesn't have a clear roadmap. I think good ideas come from unexpected places, and I try to stay open to all of it.`,

  outro: `If you're into data, AI, design, or just making cool things, feel free to reach out. I'm always down to talk, swap ideas, or build something awesome together.`,
