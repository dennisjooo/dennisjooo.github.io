# Dennis Jonathan's Portfolio

> Dennis Jonathan is an AI/ML Engineer based in Indonesia, specializing in machine learning, AI systems, and data science. He currently works at Sinarmas Land building OCR pipelines, enterprise chatbots with RAG/ReAct, and document processing systems. He holds a Bachelor of Mathematics from Universitas Prasetiya Mulya with a 3.88 GPA and is passionate about building practical AI tools that bridge the gap between complex technology and real-world applications.

Dennis is an AI enthusiast who likes taking ideas apart, figuring out how they tick, and putting them back together in a way that feels smarter. He studied Business Mathematics but now focuses on data, AI, and building systems that make life flow smoother. He cares less about chasing hype and more about quiet, useful progress: automations that save time, systems that scale well, and ideas that grow legs on their own.

Outside of work, Dennis is usually buried in ML papers, sketching side projects, or running laps in a sim rig. He loves comics, science books, and strange ideas that don't fit anywhere yet.

- AI/ML engineering and production deployment
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Computer Vision, OCR systems, and document processing
- Agentic systems with LangChain and ReAct patterns

### Act Natural - AI Interactive Theatre
An interactive theatre experience where AI characters improvise scenes together while maintaining hidden motives and secret agendas. What started as a way to kill time evolved into a fascinating exploration of agentic systems and emergent behavior.

**Technical Stack:** Groq LLMs with Gemma 2 9B for characters and Llama 3.3 70B as director, LangChain for conversation history and character state management.

**Key Innovation:** Each character maintains consistent personality, remembers past interactions, pursues hidden agendas, and reacts authentically to other characters, creating emergent drama through collaborative AI creativity.
